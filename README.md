# Code no longer maintained
**This code is no longer maintained due to a rewrite version of this project in JavaScript.**

The reason why we changed the language from python to javascript is because the package we used (discord.py) is no longer maintained by its developer. This means this project wont get extra features unless we changed the package. We chose discord.js to replace discord.py. This also means that the whole project needs a rewrite.
